# About


This repository contains **documented exercises for students** on climate data analysis and spatial risk assessment using Python.

It was developed in the context of the **ARKE research project** (*Adapting to the consequences of climate change for the Kolpingstadt Kerpen*) and uses the ARKE case study as a concrete example throughout the notebooks.



📌 You can run the notebooks interactively (e.g., in Jupyter or VS Code) and build on them for your own projects.

## 🔎 Project background: Climate Change Adpation Project "ARKE" 

This work is based on the **ARKE research project** at TH Köln, which focused on:
- climate change impacts at the municipal scale in Germany,
- risk analysis,
- and actionable workflows for planners and scientists

The exercises in this repository use the **Kerpen study area** as a concrete example.  
However, the methods and code are general and can be applied to other regions and datasets.

You can find more information about the ARKE project at:

There is also a project overview and summary in PowerPoint format inside this repo:
